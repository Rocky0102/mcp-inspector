## Known Issues

Please report any issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dhananjay-JSR/mcp-inspector/issues).

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'out/views/templates/inspector.html'`, it means the HTML, CSS, and JS files weren't copied to the output directory during compilation. Run `npm run compile` to fix this issue, as it will compile the TypeScript files and copy the necessary assets to the output directory.
